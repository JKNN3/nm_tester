[The test binaries are coming from here](https://github.com/leowz)

Put the tester inside your project folder.

chmod +x run_tests.sh

./run for mandatory tests or ./run [bonus, memory, errors, all]

You can decomment some lines in the ./srcs/test_mandatory.sh and ./srcs/test_bonus.sh scripts to see the diff function output.

You can modify srcs/test_bonus.txt adding or removing the flags/options you've done.

You can also add more test files in the ressources/ folder, it'll automatically add them in the tests.
